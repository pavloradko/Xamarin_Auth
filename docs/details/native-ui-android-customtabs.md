# Android CustomTabs (Chrome Custom Tabs)

## Features

*   possible to save up to 700 ms when opening a link with the CustomTabs by 
    connecting to the service and pre-loading Chrome.

    The loading happens as a low priority process, meaning that it won’t have any 
    negative performance impact on the application, but will give a big performance 
    boost when loading a link.    

    *   Connect to the Custom Tabs service on the `OnStart()` method of the Activities 
        planed to launch a CustomTab from
    *   Upon connection, call `Warmup()`

*   Calling `MayLaunchUrl()`

    Pre-fetching will make external content open instantly. So, if user has higher 
    likelihood of clicking on the link (let say mor than 50%), use the `MayLaunchUrl()` 
    method.

    OAuth is ideal for this, because OAuth Endpoints are well known in advance.

    Calling `MayLaunchUrl()` will make Custom Tabs pre-fetch the main page with the 
    supporting content and pre-render. This will give the maximum speed up to the page 
    loading process, but comes with a network and battery cost.

    Custom Tabs is smart and knows if the user is using the phone on a metered network or 
    if it’s a low end device and pre-rendering will have a negative effect on the overall 
    performance of the device and won’t pre-fetch or pre-render on those scenarios. 
    So, there’s no need to optimize your application for those cases.

## Low level API

Although the recommended method to integrate your application with Custom Tabs is using the 
Custom Tabs Support Library, a low level implementation is also available.

The complete implementation of the Support Library is available on Github and an be used 
as a start point. It also contains the AIDL files required to connect to the service, as the 
ones contained in the Chromium repository are not directly usable with Android Studio.
