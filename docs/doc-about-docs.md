# Doc about Docs

Maintenance docs to reduce effort. Github flavored markdown does not have
include file option, so information about the docs is kept this way.

There are sets of docs:

*	Component Docs

	*	Getting Started
	
		(../component/GettingStarted.md)[../component/GettingStarted.md]
		
	*	Details
	
		(../component/Details.md)[../component/Details.md]		

*	General (working) docs in ./docs

	These docs will be written first (all other docs are based on these)
	
	*	readme.md
	
		links to code removed and copied to  
		(../docs/GettingStarted.md)[../component/GettingStarted.md]
		
	*	readme-detailed.md
	
		Details about implementation and providers and technology. 
		
		Not copied. 
		
	*	readme-repo-root.md

		General info + appended (../component/Details.md)[../component/Details.md]
		
		(../readme.md)[../readme.md]

		(./readme-repo-root.md)[../readme-repo-root.md]
