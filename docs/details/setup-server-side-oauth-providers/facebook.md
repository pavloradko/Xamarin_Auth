## Letter for Facebok Developers' Group


Xamarin.Auth is a cross platform library for authentication purposes with OAuth for Xamarin 
and Windows platforms. It does not use native OAuth providers' SDKs like Facebook SDK, but
plain http requests and responses.

Recently Xamarin.Auth was extended with implementation for Native UI support for Installed
apps (on Android CustomTabs and on iOS SFSafariViewController). Users can easily switch between
Embedded WebView (Browser control) and Native UI

In order to use Native UI Deep/App Linking must be implemented by the app to enable callbacks 
into the app by using custom scheme[s].

Google Server side OAuth generates custom schemes in 2 different ways:

1. based on Android's package name or iOS Bundle Id. (package.name:/oauth2redirect)
2. based on App Id (com.googleusercontent.apps.<appid>:/oauth2redirect)

So, basically it is URL without authority. Custom scheme is given by google and path is arbitrary.


So questions: 

1.	From Manually Build a Login Flow

	https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/manually-build-a-login-flow

	> However, if you need to implement browser-based login for an app without using 
	> our SDKs, such as in a webview for a native desktop app (for example Windows 8), 
	> or a login flow using entirely server-side code, you can build a Login flow for 
	> yourself by using browser redirects
	
	This is what Xamarin.Auth does - uses browser redirects. Here native desktop apps
	are mentioned but only for Windows 8 (later in the docs  WebAuthenticationBroker
	is mentioned), but no notions of Android and iOS.

	Windows 8 code shows `redirect_uri=ms-app://{package-security-identifier}`, so 
	custom schemes must be supported (`ms-app` in this case).

	In the step "Invoking the Login Dialog and Setting the Redirect URL":
	
	> redirect_uri. The URL that you want to redirect the person logging in back to. 
	> This URL will capture the response from the Login Dialog. If you are using this 
	> in a webview within a desktop app, this must be set to 
	> https://www.facebook.com/connect/login_success.html. You can confirm that this 
	> URL is set for your app by going to the App Dashboard, clicking Facebook Login 
	> in the right-hand menu, and checking the Valid OAuth redirect URIs in the Client 
	> OAuth Settings section.
	
	Note: **must be set to https://www.facebook.com/connect/login_success.html**
	
	So, no custom URLs (schemes)? 
	
1. standard "native" URIs for redirect: 

	1.	urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob 
		and 
	2.	urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob:auto

Hi
I'm maintainer/developer of Xamarin.Auth Authentication library and recently it was 
extended with Native UI support (Android CustomTabs and iOS SFSafariViewController). 
This implementation was necessary due to google's new OAuth requirements/restrictions 
(Embedded WebViews are blocked).

Xamarin.Auth actually uses Manually Build Login flow, but from that doc, seems it is 
impossible to define redirect_url with custom scheme (there is explicitly stated that 
`redirect_url` must be https://www.facebook.com/connect/login_success.html)

From doc for Windows 8 seems like custom schemes are possible (ms-app) and FB SDK uses 
`fb<appid>`.

Can you help me to make minimal sample (server side setup for Facebook Login with custom 
scheme)?

Can I write a github gist in Markdown and post link here, so we can discuss it? I need 
formatting (quotes, code snippets etc)

Thanks

### Answer

OK. Solution found: The best concept for redirect_url is to use (C# 7 code):

```csharp
$"fb{fb_app_id}://authorize"
```

This works with Xamarin.Auth both Native UI and Embedded WebViews. This can be found in 
FB SDK, but seems like it is not documented.
